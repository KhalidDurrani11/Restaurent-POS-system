# Updated Checkout Workflow

## Changes Made

The checkout process has been modified to follow this new workflow:

### Before (Old Workflow):
1. **Checkout** → Immediately updates database + shows receipt
2. **Print** → Only prints receipt

### After (New Workflow):
1. **Checkout** → Shows receipt only (no database update)
2. **Print** → Prints receipt + updates database

## Implementation Details

### PosScreen.tsx Changes:
- `handleCheckout()` now only shows the receipt without calling `addSale()`
- Receipt component now receives an `onPrint` callback that triggers the database update

### Receipt.tsx Changes:
- Added `onPrint` prop to the interface
- `handlePrint()` now calls `onPrint()` after opening the print dialog
- Added visual indicator: "⚠️ Transaction will be saved when printed"
- Changed button text from "Print" to "Print & Save"

## User Experience:

1. **Add items to cart** → Cart updates normally
2. **Click Checkout** → Receipt appears with warning message (cart remains intact)
3. **Click Close** → Receipt closes, cart remains intact, no database update
4. **Click Print & Save** → Print dialog opens + database updates + cart clears + receipt closes

## Benefits:

- **Flexibility**: Users can review the receipt before committing to the database
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents accidental transactions from being saved
- **Cart Preservation**: Cart remains intact until transaction is actually saved
- **Clear Intent**: Database is only updated when user explicitly prints
- **Audit Trail**: Only printed receipts are recorded in the system

## Testing:

To test the new workflow:
1. Add items to cart
2. Click "Checkout" - verify receipt shows with warning, cart remains intact
3. Click "Close" - verify cart still has items, no database update occurs
4. Click "Checkout" again - verify same items still in cart
5. Click "Print & Save" - verify database updates and cart clears
